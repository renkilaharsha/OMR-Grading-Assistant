Summary
-------

Methods for performing data augmentation, assuming that handwritten
digits are invariant under small affine transformations.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

Alexander previously wrote something similar to the noise model when
estimating emission probabilities for a Monte Carlo simulation for
"Reading Handwritten Text."

This was implemented for David Crandall's Artificial Intelligence
course (https://github.iu.edu/cs-b551-sp2021/jkumari-jerpark-hayesall-a3).
