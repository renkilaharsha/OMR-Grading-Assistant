This signal processing techniques to find peaks in a template-matched
matrix, and can help with interpolating the peaks for where peaks
are *likely* to occur.

        Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6518811/interpolate-nan-values-in-a-numpy-array

    Input:
        - y, 1d numpy array with possible NaNs
    Output:
        - nans, logical indices of NaNs
        - index, a function, with signature indices= index(logical_indices),
          to convert logical indices of NaNs to 'equivalent' indices
    Example:
        >>> # linear interpolation of NaNs
        >>> nans, x= nan_helper(y)
        >>> y[nans]= np.interp(x(nans), x(~nans), y[~nans])
