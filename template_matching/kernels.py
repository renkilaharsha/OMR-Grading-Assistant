A collection of interesting templates for the "row finding" problem.

Summary
-------

I didn't think of obvious names for these things, so the numbering scheme is
based on the order I tried them in. ``k3`` was the one I stopped with since
it seemed like the one that produced the fewest false positives in practice.

- k1: A period and a small vertical line.
- k2: The square period kernel.
- k3: A roundish period + full edge kernel.

Methods
-------

- ``make_k1()``: Return the k1 kernel.
- ``make_k2()``: Return the k2 kernel.
- ``make_k3()``: Return the k3 kernel.
- ``blur_kernel()``: Convolve an input kernel with a Gaussian blur filter.

Usage
-----

In practice, it seems like ``k3`` with a Gaussian blur is the best choice.
